# üîç PDF Category Tracking Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## üö® **Problem Identified:**
The "Most Read by Category" chart always shows "Journal" instead of tracking actual categories being viewed.

## üîß **What I've Added:**

### 1. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
- Added detailed console logs to track PDF view processing
- Shows filename, book ID matching, category detection
- Logs every step of the PDF tracking process

### 2. **Improved Book Lookup**
- Added `getBookByPdfFilename()` method to find books by PDF filename
- Fallback mechanism when book ID pattern doesn't match filename
- Better handling of different PDF naming patterns

### 3. **Debug API Endpoint**
- Added `/api/debug/pdf-tracking` endpoint
- Shows recent PDF views with category information
- Displays category distribution and book statistics

## üß™ **Testing Steps:**

### **Step 1: Check Current Tracking**
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/debug/pdf-tracking` (after logging in)

This will show:
- Recent PDF views and their categories
- Category distribution in views
- Book category distribution

### **Step 2: Test PDF Viewing**
1. **Go to Books page** and open PDFs from different categories
2. **Watch server console** for debug messages like:
   ```
   PDF View Tracking - Filename: some_document.pdf
   PDF View Tracking - Book ID Match: 123
   PDF View Tracking - Book found: ID: 123, Category ID: 5, Category: Flyer
   PDF View Tracking - Recorded view for Book ID: 123, Category ID: 5, Category: Flyer
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify Dashboard Update**
1. **Refresh dashboard** after viewing PDFs from different categories
2. **Check "Most Read by Category" chart** - should now show correct categories

## üîç **Likely Root Causes:**

### **Cause A: PDF Filename Pattern Mismatch**
- Your PDF files might not follow the expected naming pattern
- Expected: `book_123.pdf` or `123.pdf`
- Actual: Might be random hashes like `aa40e3b9111a66f6803325f09f63274c.pdf`

### **Cause B: Missing Category Data**
- Books in database might not have proper `id_kategori` values
- Categories might all be defaulting to "Journal"

### **Cause C: Database Issues**
- `tbl_pdf_views` table might not exist or have wrong structure
- PDF views might not be getting recorded properly

## üõ†Ô∏è **Quick Fixes to Try:**

### **Fix 1: Manual Category Test**
Run this SQL to check your data:
```sql
-- Check what categories your books actually have
SELECT k.nama_kategori, COUNT(b.id_buku) as book_count
FROM tbl_buku b
LEFT JOIN tbl_kategori k ON b.id_kategori = k.id_kategori
GROUP BY k.nama_kategori
ORDER BY book_count DESC;
```

### **Fix 2: Check PDF Views Table**
```sql
-- Check if PDF views are being recorded
SELECT * FROM tbl_pdf_views ORDER BY viewed_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### **Fix 3: Test PDF Filename Matching**
```sql
-- See sample PDF filenames in your database
SELECT title, lampiran, k.nama_kategori
FROM tbl_buku b
LEFT JOIN tbl_kategori k ON b.id_kategori = k.id_kategori
WHERE lampiran IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

## üìä **Expected Results After Fix:**

1. **Server Console** should show detailed PDF tracking logs
2. **Debug API** should show PDF views with different categories
3. **Dashboard Chart** should display actual category distribution
4. **Each PDF view** should be tracked with correct category

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the fixes** by viewing PDFs from different categories
2. **Monitor server logs** to see if tracking is working
3. **Check the debug endpoint** to verify data
4. **If still showing "Journal"** - check the database queries above

The enhanced logging will tell us exactly what's happening with the category tracking! üéØ
